contains n integers - A1,A2,......An.For each given test case tell whether the given sequence 
will be liked by Jiya.

INPUT FORMAT-

First line constains t number of test cases.

Every test case has first line as the number of intergers the sequence contains, followed by 
sequence in the next line.

OUTPUT FORMAT -

Print "YES" or "NO",whether Jiya likes the sequence or not.

CONSTRAINTS-

1 ≤ t ≤ 100

1 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10, for all i
